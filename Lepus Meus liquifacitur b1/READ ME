Lepus meus liquifaciturEric Silverberg	silverberg@stanford.eduAdam Goldman agoldman@leland.stanford.eduSuzanne Aldrich aigeanta@cs.stanford.eduAll of the required features work. We also have rudimentary saving working so that the resources will come back in when you open a saved file, but the pages & shapes don'tyet come in. We also have a pretty cool shape inspector, with a popup resource list.Please let us know if you have any problems.Thanks,Eric, Adam and Suzanne
