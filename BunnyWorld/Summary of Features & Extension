********** Summary of Extensions ***********	Our catalog supports drag and drop sounds and pictures (try it from the scrapbook).	You can delete pages, sounds and pictures from the catalog. Deleting a page deletes all shapes on the page. Deleteing/renaming a picture updates all the shapes' links to it.	Our catalog also can be controlled from the keyboard. Use the arrow keys to navigate up and down, then return and enter keys to edit/preview an item, and the delete key to remove an item. 	Our shape inspector has a popup menu for selecting picts, has fields for editing the coordinates, and has a tabbed window for editing the script.	Our tools palette can be controlled via the keyboard. Press 'm' for the rectangle, and 'v' for the arrow.	Our script editor is fault-tolerant and supports literal names. It also ignores whitespace and returns. Additionally, you can specify pages a variety of ways:	goto page 1	goto page "hellow there"	goto start	goto page startif you enter something it doesn't understand, it will just ignore it.Our possessions window automatically resizes shapes when you put them in to be 50x50. We have also implemented an auto-centering feature, so when you move the shape in and out of the possessions window, it will center itself around the cursor. Otherwise, it is possible for the shape to resize itself in such a way that it is nowhere near the cursor but still being moved. Shapes also don't go outside of the boundaries of the window.We have a lock icon draw over a shape if a shape is locked.We have help balloons which appear over the menu items.When you draw a shape, if the cursor gets away from the end point you are adjusting, the endpoint will automatically jump to where your cursor is. ******* other notes *********We're using a preferences file for a temporary storage area. It gets deleted when the game is quit.******* what doesn't work ********we don't know of anything directly that doesn't work. However, we did have some random hard freezes while in mid-drag of shapes & using app extensively. Why these things happen we don't know and really can't test because everything dies. =/
